Experiences & Incidents in Nakul's Life: 
 1. Fun Incidents in Life: One time in first year in college, it was a raining, and class got over, he was wearing shoes those were little slippery in normal floor, and everyone was standing whole crowd of multiple classed, under a building and there was another building 20 steps far , which has shade, so some people were running, most were standing, so he also ran away and got slipped and fell down in front of whole crowd in ground gap filled water + heavy rain coming from top too, Hahahahahah!
2. Sad/Bad Incident: None, Because he believes that everything happening is with God's Grace, so Whatever is happening is for Good and gives some Learning.
3. Experience/Learning/Problem Solved: Life Experience: A relative of his ask him to design a website for them, they were working in excel entrying data of donation everymonth, they were not sure about they want website/app or something else, so Nakul understands their problem - deep problem, he got to know is for which they are finding solution, as they face issue in tracking each cell where to do entry manually and do it very often for multiple users and every month too, as they are reaching certain age, so first day, nakul explored all the technologies usefull after creating a website layout design - while exlporing technologies he kept in mind, what he knows, what he don't and how much time it will take to learn something new , and new if related to his career or not useful after this project, while keeping in mind, his own time, he was working on his own project by then, he was just visitng those relateives for a day, and this project was not professional, informal Request, so he worked fully first day in searching and all withouyt much internet access as it was a remote area, then next to next day when he reached home, he again started finding solutions, and finally got to know about Excel Automation can be done, but since it requires a new language and code, he for first time used CoPilot to create in new code language , full demo, of what they needed, and they agreed that it would work, Soltion was - Creating Visual tables and automate all the logic, which simplified the process of finding each entry to do, using a table with all users feed, and their data it beacame easy even for a non excel to use it and also to generate summary of user Depositions using one click in different formats! , Nakul Thinks: why he was able to find solution which not only took his much time and still worked for Client, because he focused on what his problem was , because what they needed was not clear, so he decided to explore more and found a solution, which was not only quick but also efficient and effective. Also this time, he finally Found AI as a helper/ technology before he knew about it but not have used much.. After that incidence , he got intreseted in AI technology and now uses it very efficeintly in increasing Product development, learning, finding issues, fast track his growth.
   Informal Experience: While he was competing in Esports, he used to Grind Day and night , without any laziness or seeing his teammates not working for it, and gave it almost all, but then situations changed, when he left unemployed + timing in his career, he started focusing more on his Career, now its been 9 months almost, he is in full time just in development and he is liking it very much actually.

Negative Points:
He starts thinking about new project while he is on one project working, feeling its not going well, everything he planned is not wokring then it might not be worth doing, but he doesn't give up and start another project, he notes down that new idea and keep working on project in hand, as he believes in never giving up, he sticks to it till the end, at which he doesn't have any options left or its not worth giving any more time in it with current knowledge or trend! I can tell all this as he was working on his project INterviewSphere, where he managed to pull off a lot of things, but when he was stuck on Collaboration Feature in Coding & Canvas, he tried multiple ways to implement it, but none of them were working out as expected, he was facing issue , bcz he didn't knew Typescript nor Next.Js,  he didn't give up, instead he kept trying exloring solutions Yjs collab, Code Editors like monaco etc. then he decides smartly to not waste more time stucked in this and started learning Typescript through Book and not wasting time, he also started next Project he had in Mind, Productive Pulse which is onGoing right now. This shows that he is very disciplined person, he always tries to achieve his goals, while keepig Time in mind - to not waste it
